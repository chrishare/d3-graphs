        Graphics, and it's major characteristic is that in can grow or shrink and still look good, because the image consists of shapes whose positions
        are defined with numbers that we can scale cleanly. Contract this to, say, JPGs, which would might have much richer detail, but look jagged when
        scaled. SVG is built into modern browsers - we don't need to include any special scripts. */

            /* Here we define scales - functions that will convert the magnitude of a value in one domain to some other range. Why would we want to do that? 
            Well, in this chart, we might have data (message counts) ranging from 0 to 30000, but we need to convert a given value in that domain back to a 
            screen size range, so it can be graphed. For example, if our data his a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 30000, then an item of value 15000 is 50% of the
            way up in that domain. If the range of our screen size is 0 to, say, 1000 pixels, then 50% of 1000 is 500 - and that's how big our line would need to 
            be in pixels. That's a pretty trivial example, but they can get a lot more complex than that - sometimes, they won't be linear, or they'll be 
            time-based, or we'll need to go the other direction - from screen size back to data. The scale methods save us doing many of these calculations 
            ourselves. */
            /* First off, here's out x scale for our categories. We want the scale to be a band of items, rather than a continuous set of numbers. The range is
            our screen width, in pixels, and the domain we convert from will be out different categories. We feed in each item from our dataset and the scale
            keeps track of them for us. How we will use this scale is to get the horizontal position of the bar to write - for instance, x('categoryA') 
            might be 100, meaning categoryA's bar should be 100 pixels to the right. Note that the range is from 0 to width, meaning later items in our
            domain will get bigger values from the scale. Padding will tell D3 how much space to put between the bars - try playing with this value! */

            from our data set. Note that our range starts at height (say, 1000 pixels) and ends with 0. This will result in us getting lower values for 
            the bigger data values we pass in. We want this behaviour of the way drawing in SVG works - left to right, but top to bottom rather than bottom
            to top. We're assuming our minimum logical data is 0, and we're also using a d3.max convenience function to get the biggest data item. */
